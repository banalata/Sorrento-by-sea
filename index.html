            <p>
                "So sorry we had to go home after only one night. We will definitely stay two nights next time!"
                "This apartment is close to everything. We didn't need the car as the walks were amazing"
                "Your attention to detail made our stay so relaxed and comfortable. It was such a shame we had to drive
                back to our little flat, which is smaller than your apartment. We want to move in!"
                "Cosy and comfortable. We imagined we owned it and enjoyed being spoilt. Thank you."
                "What a magical stay at such an amazing place. Completely self-contained and very private. We loved it
                and will return again and again."
                "Never felt so spoilt. A perfect get away and so close to everything. We had the best bath ever!"
                "A few minutesâ€™ walk from the beach, picnic basket in hand and towel over the shoulder - can't think of
                anything better except that wonderful breakfast. That bacon is the best in Melbourne!"
                Relaxing in that sunny garden watching our dog chasing balls. Let me stay forever!"
